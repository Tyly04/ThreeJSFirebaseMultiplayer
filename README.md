# ThreeJSFirebaseMultiplayer
A Three JS Multiplayer game using Firebase. Just so you know, I didn't add the walking around and collision detection. 
This was thanks to: 
[Web Maestro](https://github.com/WebMaestroFr/collisions-detection-three-js)

I got the inspiration from [jgordon510](https://github.com/jgordon510) and [Firebase Asteroids](https://mmoasteroids.firebaseapp.com/).
I used the 3D Javascript Engine [ThreeJS by Mr. Doob](https://threejs.org).
